Simply run the EXE, set the date and time you wish to put your pc to sleep or shutdown, and it creates a task in windows task scheduler.

Created this because some stress testing programs like OCCT don't allow your PC to go to sleep with the normal windows Sleep through the power plan. 
If I run a 5 hr stress test overnight in OCCT, my PC is left running until I physically wake up and shut the computer off.
This allows you to set a Date and Time to shutdown or put system to sleep. So if I wanted to run a 5hr stress test starting at 10PM, I could set it so that my PC goes to sleep at 3:15AM the next morning.

Some programs, OCCT included, don't save test results. So shutting the computer down would render the test useless as you would have no clue if the test passed or failed. I use the sleep method in these scenarios, as waking the computer will keep all existing programs open and not close out of any results etc.
